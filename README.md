# Prefect 2 with Docker Compose

This repository contains everything you need to run Prefect Orion, a Prefect agent, or the Prefect CLI using Docker Compose.

Thanks to Paco Iba√±ez for his excellent work in this repository, which helped me get started: [https://github.com/fraibacas/prefect-orion](https://github.com/fraibacas/prefect-orion)! I don't intend to replace his work. Instead, my repository uses Docker Compose to help you experiment with Prefect 2 locally and explore the different pieces you may need to run in a production environment.

# Why Docker Compose?

There are a few reasons you might want to run Prefect using Docker or Docker Compose:
* You want to try Prefect without installing anything new on your workstation. 
* You are comfortable with Docker and prefer it over virtual environments or Anaconda. 
* You want to run Prefect on a system like CentOS 7 where installing Prefect dependencies is difficult.

# Prerequisites

* A Linux, MacOS, or Windows computer or VM with Docker installed. If you are running Windows, you must have Docker set up to use Linux containers, not Windows containers.

# Limitations

* If you run a Prefect agent in Docker, it will not be able to run `DockerContainer` deployments because Docker-in-Docker is not supported. 

# Getting Started

Start by cloning this repository.

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains four services:
* `database` - Postgres database for the Orion API
* `orion` - Prefect Orion API and UI
* `agent` - Prefect Orion Agent
* `cli` - A container that mounts this repository's `flows` directory and offers an ideal environment for building and applying deployments and running flows. 

## Prefect Orion
To try Prefect locally, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository, and run:

```
docker-compose --profile orion up
```

This will start PostgreSQL and Prefect Orion. When Orion is ready, you will see a line that looks like:

```
orion_1     | INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:4200 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The Orion API container shares port 4200 with the host machine, so if you open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` you will see the Prefect Orion UI.

## Prefect CLI

Next, open another terminal in the same directory and run:

```
docker-compose run cli
```

This runs an interactive Bash session in a container that shares a Docker network with the Orion server you just started. If you run `ls`, you will see that the container shares the `flows` subdirectory of the repository on the host machine:

```
flow.py
root@fb032110b1c1:~/flows#
```

To demonstrate the container is connected to the Orion API you launched earlier, run:

```
python flow.py
```

Then, in a web browser on your host machine, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/runs` and you will see the flow you just ran in your CLI container.

If you'd like to use the CLI container to interact with Prefect Cloud instead of a local Orion instance, update `docker-compose.yml` and change the agent service's `PREFECT_API_URL` environment variable to match your Prefect Cloud API URL. Then, uncomment the `PREFECT_API_KEY` environment variable and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own API key. If you'd prefer not to put your API key in a Docker Compose file, you can also store it in an environment variable on your host machine and pass it through to Docker Compose like so:

```
- PREFECT_API_KEY=${PREFECT_API_KEY}
```

## Prefect Agent

You can run a Prefect Agent by updating `docker-compose.yml` and changing `YOUR_WORK_QUEUE_NAME` to match the name of the Prefect work queue you would like to connect to, and then running the following command:

```
docker-compose --profile agent up
```

This will run a Prefect agent and connect to the work queue you provided. 

As with the CLI, you can also use Docker Compose to run an agent that connects to Prefect Cloud by updating the agent's `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` settings in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Next Steps

You're not limited to running one profile at a time. For example, if you have created a deployment and want to start and agent for it, but don't want to open two separate terminals to run Orion and an agent, you can start them both at once by running: 

```
docker compose --profile orion --profile agent up
```

And if you want to start two separate agents that pull from different work queues? No problem! Just duplicate the agent service, give it a different name, and set its work queue name. For example:

```
agent_two:
    image: prefecthq/prefect:2.3.0-python3.10
    restart: always
    entrypoint: ["prefect", "agent", "start", "-q", "YOUR_OTHER_WORK_QUEUE_NAME"]
    environment:
      - PREFECT_API_URL=http://orion:4200/api
    profiles: ["agent"]
```
Now, when you run `docker-compose --profile agent up`, both agents will start, connect to the Orion API, and begin polling their work queues.
